UCS Snapshot Report

Create a UCS Snapshot Report

=head1 Purpose

This document provides instructions on how to create a UCS Snapshot report using two simple perl scripts.

=over

=item 1 

snapshot-mit.pl - to create a UCS MIT (Management Information Tree or configuration management database) Snapshot and save 
it in xml format in a file.  

=item 2 

ucs-snapshot-report - to create a UCS Snapshot Report from a UCS MIT snapshot.  The UCS Snapshot Report is an html based report. 

=back

We will describe the installation and setup of each script independently since they may be installed and run 
on different servers.  

=head1 snapshot-mit.pl

The snapshot-mit.pl script is used to take a snapshot of the MIT.  To do this, ip connectivity to the UCS Manager 
and read privileges are required.  



We assume that you have downloaded and installed the UcsSimple-CommMgr perl module.
It can be downloaded from : 

    https://github.com/greygoose/UcsSimple-CommMgr

We also assume that you have downloaded the demo directory for the ucs-backup scripts.

    https://github.com/greygoose/UcsSimple-CommMgr/tree/master/demo/ucs-backup

We will refer to the local copy of this directory as "UCS_BACKUP_HOME".    
It contains the following subdirectories:

	assets - contains css and javascript that are used by the reports. 
	cfg - contains configuration files that are used by the applications (described below).
	doc - some documents.
	schema - put your UCSM-IN schema file here.

Download the UCS XML schema for the UCS Manager that you are running.  This can be downloaded from the Cisco Developer's 
Network and can be copied into UCS_BACKUP_HOME/schema/

Once you have downloaded these artifacts, you will update the "UCS_BACKUP_HOME/cfg/backup.cfg for your installation.  
This file has the following settings:

    # Configuration settings for the test application.
    [UCS]
    URI	= https://ucs-vip/nuova
    UNAME = USERNAME
    PASSWORD = PASSWORD

    [APP]
    LOG4PERL = /home/ikent/ucs-backup/cfg/log.cfg
    SCHEMA = /home/ikent/ucs-backup/schema/UCSM-IN.xsd
    CSS_DIR = /home/ikent/ucs-backup/assets
    BACKUP_HOME = /home/ikent/ucs-backup/backup
    MAX_BACKUP_FILES = 7

(Please note the lack of security in storing credentials in a configuration file).


=head2 Approach

There are two steps to producing a backup report. 

=over


=item 1 

Query the MIT and save it in a backup file.

=item 2 

Create a report from the queried backup file.

=back



=head2 Query and persist the MIT

This can be done by running the following command:

    ucs-backup-mit --cfg=./cfg/backup.cfg 

The MIT will be stored in an xml file in the BACKUP_DIR (as specified in the backup.cfg configuration file).
File will be similar in form to the following:

    ucs-backup-report backup/ucs-backup-2013-07-30-22_36_43.xml


=head2 Create a UCS Backup Report 

We can create a backup report using the following command:

    ucs-backup-report --cfg=./cfg/backup.cfg --xml=./backup/ucs-backup-2013-07-30-22_36_43.xml

Now, we can open the report in our browser.  The filename will be index.html.
