UCS Snapshot Report

Create a UCS Snapshot Report

=head1 Purpose

This document provides instructions on how to create a UCS Snapshot and UCS Snapshot Report.

=head2 Approach

We can use two simple scripts to create a UCS Snapshot and UCS Snapshot Report: 

=over

=item 1 

snapshot-mit.pl - to create a UCS MIT (Management Information Tree or configuration management database) Snapshot and save 
it in xml format in a file.  

=item 2 

ucs-snapshot-report - to create a UCS Snapshot Report from a UCS MIT snapshot.  The UCS Snapshot Report is html format. 

=back


We will describe the installation and setup for each script independently since they may be installed and run 
on different servers.


=head2 snapshot-mit.pl

The snapshot-mit.pl script will create a UCS MIT Snapshot.  It requires:

=over

=item 1 

IP connectivity to UCS Manager;

=item 2 

Perl;

=item 3

UCSM Manager Credentials (only read-only is required);

=back



Download and unzip the ucs-snapshot.tar.gz archive from here:

	https://github.com/greygoose/UcsSimple-CommMgr/blob/master/demo/ucs-snapshot.tar.gz

For clarity, we refer to the top-level directory as SNAPSHOT_HOME.  The pertinent directories are: 

	bin - contains the perl script ucs-snapshot-report.pl 
	cfg - contains configuration files that are used by the applications (described below).

Edit the script's configuration file SNAPSHOT_HOME/cfg/snapshot.cfg as appropriate for
your UCS domain and snapshot directory.  The configuration file contains the following settings:

    #
    # Configuration settings for the snapshot-report.pl.
    #
    [UCS]
    URI     = https://ucs-vip-ip/nuova
    UNAME = admin
    PASSWORD = PASSWORD

    [APP]
    # Local directory to store the UCS MIT Snapshot to:
    BACKUP_HOME = /home/ucsdev/ucs-snapshot/snapshots

    # Maximum number of backup files to retain 
    MAX_BACKUP_FILES = 7


We will use the script SNAPSHOT_HOME/bin/snapshot-mit.pl to create a UCS MIT snapshot. 
It can be launched as follows: 
    ./bin/snapshot-mit.pl --cfg=./cfg/snapshot.cfg

The script will produce a MIT snapshot file with the time-stamp in its name, such as: 
    /home/ucsdev/ucs-snapshot/snapshots/ucs-snapshot-2013-07-30-22_36_43.xml


=head2 ucs-snapshot-report

This ucs-snapshot-report script can be used to create a report from a UCS MIT Snapshot.
The script has the following requirements:

=over

=item 1 

Perl;

=item 2

Perl module XML::LibXML which has dependencies on libxml2. 
 
=item 3

Sufficient memory and disk space for processing UCS Snapshots since they are large files;

Download the UcsSimple-CommMgr package from here: 
	https://github.com/greygoose/UcsSimple-CommMgr

Install the package - one effective way to install it and resolve package dependencies is by 
using cpanm as follows:

    sudo cpanm -I UcsSimple-CommMgr-0.0001.tar.gz

Download and unzip the ucs-snapshot.tar.gz archive from here:

	https://github.com/greygoose/UcsSimple-CommMgr/blob/master/demo/ucs-snapshot.tar.gz

For clarity, we refer to the top-level directory as SNAPSHOT_HOME.  
The directory structure is as follows:

	bin - contains the perl script ucs-backup-report.pl 
	cfg - contains configuration files that are used by the applications (described below).
	assets - contains css and javascript that are used by the reports. 
	schema - put your UCSM-IN schema file here.

Edit the script's configuration file SNAPSHOT_HOME/cfg/report.cfg as appropriate for
your UCS domain and snapshot directory.  The configuration file contains the following settings:

    #
    # Configuration settings for the UCS Snapshort report application ucs-snapshot-report.
    #
    [APP]
    SCHEMA = /home/ucsdev/ucs-snapshot/schema/UCSM-IN.xsd
    CSS_DIR = /home/ucsdev/ucs-snapshot/assets
    BACKUP_HOME = /ucsdev/ikent/ucs-snapshot/snapshots

Download the UCS XML schema for the UCS Manager version that you are running.  This can be downloaded from the Cisco Developer's 
Network and can be copied into UCS_BACKUP_HOME/schema/

You can generate a UCS MIT Report as follows:
    
	ucs-snapshot-report --cfg=./cfg/report.cfg --xml=./snapshot/ucs-snapshot-2013-07-30-22_36_43.xml

Open the report file (index.html) in your browser.


=head2 Security 

The config files are used to store authentication information and thus care should be taken to
assure they are properly protected. 

The perl script turns off client side authentication.  You can edit the code to add if required.
