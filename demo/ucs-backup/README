UCS MIT Backup Report

Backing up the MIT

=head1 Purpose

This document provides instructions on how to use the ucs-backup-mit and ucs-backup-report applications
to query the MIT and create a report of its contents.


=head1 Setup

We assume that you have downloaded and installed the UcsSimple-CommMgr perl module.
It can be downloaded from : 

    https://github.com/greygoose/UcsSimple-CommMgr

We also assume that you have downloaded the demo directory for the ucs-backup scripts.
    
    https://github.com/greygoose/UcsSimple-CommMgr/demo/ucs-backup

We will refer to the local copy of this directory as "UCS_BACKUP_HOME".    
It contains the following subdirectories:

	assets - contains css and javascript that are used by the reports. 
	cfg - contains configuration files that are used by the applications (described below).
	doc - some documents.
	schema - put your UCSM-IN schema file here.

Download the UCS XML schema for the UCS Manager that you are running.  This can be downloaded from the Cisco Developer's 
Network and can be copied into UCS_BACKUP_HOME/schema/

Once you have downloaded these artifacts, you will update the "UCS_BACKUP_HOME/cfg/backup.cfg for your installation.  
This file has the following settings:

    # Configuration settings for the test application.
    [UCS]
    URI	= https://nikon-A/nuova
    UNAME = admin
    PASSWORD = Nbv12345

    [APP]
    LOG4PERL = /home/ikent/ucs-backup/cfg/log.cfg
    SCHEMA = /home/ikent/ucs-backup/schema/UCSM-IN.xsd
    CSS_DIR = /home/ikent/ucs-backup/assets
    BACKUP_HOME = /home/ikent/ucs-backup/backup
    MAX_BACKUP_FILES = 7

(Please note the lack of security in storing credentials in a configuration file).



=head2 Approach

There are two steps to producing a backup report. 

=over


=item 1 

Query the MIT and save it in a backup file.

=item 2 

Create a report from the queried backup file.

=back



=head2 Query and persist the MIT

This can be done by running the following command:

    ucs-backup-mit --cfg=./cfg/backup.cfg 

The MIT will be stored in an xml file in the BACKUP_DIR (as specified in the backup.cfg configuration file).
File will be similar in form to the following:

    backup/ucs-backup-2013-07-30-22_36_43.xml


=head2 Create a UCS Backup Report 

We can create a backup report using the following command:

    ucs-backup-report --cfg=./cfg/backup.cfg --xml=./backup/ucs-backup-2013-07-30-22_36_43.xml

Now, we can open the report in our browser.  The filename will be index.html.
